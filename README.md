# HR System

Welcome to the HR System!

## Features

- **TODO** : Add detailed feature descriptions here.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

2. Install NPM packages in 2 frontend folder and 1 backend folder

```
npm install
```

### Run the project

In the root folder, we've included a simple package.json file with predefined scripts for running the frontend and backend concurrently.

- Angular Server: http://localhost:4200/
- React Server: http://localhost:5173/
- Express Server: http://localhost:3000/

```
"scripts": {
    "react": "cd frontend/react-app && npm run dev",
    "angular": "cd frontend/angular-app && ng serve",
    "backend": "cd backend && npm run dev",
    "frontend": "concurrently \"npm run react\" \"npm run angular\"",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run frontend\" \"npm run backend\""
}
```

- Note that our Angular app is version 14. If it cannot run with your Node.js version, try:

In Bashï¼š
`export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

In Powershell:
`$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"`
